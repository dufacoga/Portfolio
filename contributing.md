# 🤝 Contributing

Thanks for taking a moment to contribute! Whether you're here to report a bug, suggest an idea, or submit code — it’s genuinely appreciated.

This portfolio was built with **Blazor WebAssembly** and **pure CSS**, so the contribution process is simple and focused on C#, Razor components, and design logic.

## 🛠 Development Setup

This is a Blazor WebAssembly project, so to run it locally:

1. Make sure you have the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
3. Restore dependencies and run the application:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Then open your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) or the port shown in your terminal.

## 🎯 Code Style & Commit Guidelines

To keep things clean and consistent:

- Use meaningful commit messages. Start with a verb (e.g., `Fix`, `Add`, `Update`) and avoid ending with punctuation.
- Example: `Improve responsive layout for GitHub projects section`

Blazor encourages component-based thinking, so feel free to split logic into new `.razor` or `.cs` files if needed.
